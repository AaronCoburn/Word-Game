/* This is me thinking about how I am going to make me a Word Game;
What I want in my game;
I want to have the diconary for the words to be created and stored inside the mapped blocks in the Level
I want some of the words mapped to the blocks in the Level using arrays
I want some of the words not to be mapped in the level for secret and extra pointing FileSystem
I want the letter to appear in the bottom of the page and are able to be shuffled
I always want there to be one or more words that are a total of the mac amount of letter in a Level
I want the level to a certain amounts of hints 
I want user to click and drag the word on to the empty spaced array at the missing word
If user changes mind also want to be able to put the letter back on the hand in it's space or if stop missed the letter goes back home
A hint will light up the word's letter empty to the hand's letter for the user to see where to place





 I want the Levels to be Saveable for another time */
